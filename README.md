**Easy-Downloads**

Code to make us more lazy!

Easily download files directly into your desired folder without the hassle of navigating through the default Downloads directory.
The script DownloadAndMove.py is a Python utility to organize your Downloads folder automatically.

**How it Works-**
  It monitors your ~/Downloads directory.
  When a new file is downloaded, it checks its extension.
  Based on the extension, it moves the file into a categorized subfolder (e.g., Images, Docs, Videos, Music, etc.).

**Why I built it-**
  I created this project to practice working with Python libraries for handling HTTP requests, file I/O, and user input. The goal was to build something lightweight but useful,   while strengthening my understanding of Python basics.

**Features-**
  **Direct Folder Downloads**: Specify your desired folder, and the script will download files directly into it.  
  **User-Friendly Interface**: Minimal input requiredâ€”just provide the folder name.  
  **Automated Process:** Reduces manual steps, making file downloads more efficient.
